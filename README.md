**Unpunctuality Analysis at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX): Trends, Key Airlines, and Peak Delay Times**
This project focused on analyzing flight unpunctuality patterns at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to identify trends, key airlines, and specific time periods associated with delays.
Key objectives included calculating the percentage of unpunctual flights, average delay times, and the top three airlines with the highest unpunctuality rates.
Additional analyses looked at unpunctuality by week, weekday, and hour, revealing potential peak times and routes prone to delays.
Insights from these analyses aim to inform operational improvements, prioritize resources during peak delay times, and enhance collaboration with airlines to reduce unpunctuality rates.
